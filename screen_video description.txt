The project is completed using PyTorch, python 2.7 (should also work on py35),
and CUDA
Full list of dependencies are in import section of "UnetTrain.py".
...more details are explained in report and Github

The model was train for 5hrs. The best model was saved with the name:
"Leg21_model_saved"

The model can be loaded and run in machine with CPU or GPU.
Test time per image using GPU is around 0.85sec
Test time per image using CPU is much slower (around 15-40secs)
